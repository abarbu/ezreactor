Ludum Dare 46 "Keep it alive"

A simulation of a nuclear reactor core in Haskell. Up to about 1,000,000
neutrons are simulated bouncing around the core of the reactor. Your job is to
hit energy targets while keeping the reactor stable.

The physics of the world changes each time. You'll never know if you've got a
nuclear bomb on your hands or a reactor that will barely start and plod along.
