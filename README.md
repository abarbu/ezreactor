Ludum Dare 46 "Keep it alive"

A simulation of a nuclear reactor core in Haskell. Up to about1,000,000 neutrons
are simulated bouncing around the core of the reactor. Your job is to hit energy
targets while keeping the reactor stable. The physics of the world changes
subtly each time, so you'll never know if you've got an extremely twitchy
reactor or something very slow.
